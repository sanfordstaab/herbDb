    <!-- recipe goes here -->
    Gather berry clusters after the first <u>hard</u> frost.
    Remove stems and place berries in a large pan.
    Heat slowly, mashing the berries.
    Pour the juice and berries into a clean pillowcase and hang 
    above a lare pot and let it drip/drain overnight
    (you can skip this part if using a juicer).
    The next morning, measure the juice and add an equal amount of honey.
    Simmer over medium-high heat until thick and of a syrup-like consistency.
    Pour into sterilized bottles and seal in a boiling water bath for twenty minutes.
    Use as a cold preventative.
