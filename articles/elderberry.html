    Pick bunches of elderberries when they are ripe and black but still firm and shiny.
    The easiest way to strip them from their stems is to use a fork.
    To harvest the flowers for drying, pick whole, sweet-smelling heads and spread 
    them on brown paper; when dry, use a fork to stirp the blossoms off of the stems.
